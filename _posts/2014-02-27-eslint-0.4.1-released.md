# ESLint 0.4.1 released

We just pushed ESLint 0.4.1, which is a minor release mostly to fix some bugs introduced in 0.4.0.

## CLI

* Added TAP formatter
* Changed color in stylish formatter so it won't be ugly on Windows

## Rules

* New Rule: `[space-in-brackets](/docs/rules/space-in-brackets.html)`
* New Rule: `[no-constant-condition](/docs/rules/no-constant-condition.html)`
* Fix: the `[radix](/docs/rules/radix.html)` rule previously would throw an error if it found `parseInt()` called without arguments, this has been fixed
* Fix: the `[semi](/docs/rules/semi.html)` rule previously missed some statements, this has been fixed
* Fix: the `[no-dupe-keys](/docs/rules/no-dupe-keys.html)` rule was incorrectly flagging getter/setter combinations as duplicates, this has been fixed
* Fix: the `[valid-jsdoc](/docs/rules/valid-jsdoc.html)` rule was missing some function declarations, this has been fixed
* Update: the `[valid-jsdoc](/docs/rules/valid-jsdoc.html)` rule was changed so that `@return` isn't flagged as an error by default
* Update: the `[semi](/docs/rules/semi.html)` rule now allows you to specify that semicolons should not be used

## Breaking Changes

There are no breaking changes in this release.
